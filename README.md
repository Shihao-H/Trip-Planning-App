### Lacey Willmann
   First and foremost, I really hate writing about myself. I am old. I am a senior in the CS program. I am switching careers after retiring with a disability. I had no programming experience before starting school at CSU. I enjoy C and C ++. Sadomasochistic? Maybe. I enjoy challenging assignments. I work well under pressure, but, again, I am old, so I would much rather not stress myself. I am at the halfway mark for average life expectancy and my kids are almost 18. Why speed up the process and lose the enjoyable years? I have worked in team environments since I started working. That was probably before most of this class was born. I have worked in supervisory roles from 1999 until I retired in 2013.
