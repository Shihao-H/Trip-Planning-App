### Lacey Willmann
    First and foremost, I really hate writing about myself. I am old. I am a senior in the CS program. I am
switching careers after retiring with a disability. I had no programming experience before starting school at CSU. I enjoy C and C ++.
Sado Masochistic? Maybe. I enjoy challenging assignments. I work well under pressure, but, again, I am old, so I would much rather
not stress myself. I am at the halfway mark for average life expectancy and my kids are almost 18. Why speed up the process and lose
the enjoyable years? I have worked in team environments since I started working. That was probably before most of this class was born.
I have worked in supervisory roles from 1999 until I retired in 2013. I was the supervisor everyone loved. Not because I was easy to 
work under, but because I expected everyone to do their job, I handled issues before they became major problems, and I worked
along with the employees I was supervising. I have a strong work ethic. I am great at problem solving.
