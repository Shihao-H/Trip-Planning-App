### Lacey Willmann
    First and foremost, I really hate writing about myself. I am old. I am a senior in the CS program. I am
switching careers after retiring with a disability. I had no programming experience before starting school at CSU. I enjoy C and C ++.
Sado Masochistic? Maybe. I enjoy challenging assignments. I work well under pressure, but, again, I am old, so I would much rather
not stress myself. I am at the halfway mark for average life expectancy and my kids are almost 18. Why speed up the process and lose
the enjoyable years? I have worked in team environments since I started working. That was probably before most of this class was born.
I have worked in supervisory roles from 1999 until I retired in 2013. I was the supervisor everyone loved. Not because I was easy to 
work under, but because I expected everyone to do their job, I handled issues before they became major problems, and I worked
along with the employees I was supervising. I have a strong work ethic. I am great at problem solving. 

### Shihao Huang
    I am a senior in both CS and Stat. Don't worry about prouncing my name wrong, I am really fine with that.

As a Chinese students, the reason why I am here is quite unexpected, when I was preparing my university entrance exam in high school, CSU and my high school they just formed a partnership program then I joined it and started my college career here.

I would say my English is good most of time but when it comes to some new concepts, local adage or sayings I don't konw, I still need to use my phone dictionary. If some day you find me suddenly being silent when communicating with you, I may just need to organize my language.

I consider myself an independent and self-displined person, I have procrastination but usually I will set myself a deadline before the true deadline. I have two siblings, they are the most invaluable gift that I received from my parents. Travelling and communicating with people from different background fasinate me. It is too young for me to write a bio(LOL), but as a materilist, I hope I can earn it every single day.

### Josh Keahey
I am currently a senior in CS, and I finished my math minor last semester. I have been going to school for a while now, as it took 
me a long time to figure out what I wanted to do with my life. After working some... not super exciting jobs for a while, I moved to 
China for 6 months in 2013. The trip changed my life, and helped me decide to come back and try to get a job in the gaming industry.
This major has not always been the easiest for me, but it has undoubtedly been rewarding and fun. In other walks of life, I love 
running, music, board games, making people laugh, and (it should go without saying) video games. Also, if there some piece of 
random knowledge or pop culture reference, there is a high chance I will know it. I have so much utterly pointless information in
my head.
