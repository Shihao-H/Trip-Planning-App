### Minjie Shen

This is Minjie. I am a senior Computer Science student, minoring in Maths.
I am a transfer student, this is my third year in Colorado State University. 
I studied in East China Normal University, China for two years and then transferred to CSU. 
I was an Electrical Engineering student and I have studied EE for 4 years. I tried to study both EE and CS at a time, but I just failed because it was so challenging to me. I realized that I preferred CS to EE, so I kept my CS major and got rid of the EE major.
I am so glad to work with all of you. I hope we could get everything done perfectly.


### Lacey Willmann
   First and foremost, I really hate writing about myself. I am old. I am a senior in the CS program. I am switching careers after retiring with a disability. I had no programming experience before starting school at CSU. I enjoy C and C ++. Sadomasochistic? Maybe. I enjoy challenging assignments. I work well under pressure, but, again, I am old, so I would much rather not stress myself. I am at the halfway mark for average life expectancy and my kids are almost 18. Why speed up the process and lose the enjoyable years? I have worked in team environments since I started working. That was probably before most of this class was born. I have worked in supervisory roles from 1999 until I retired in 2013.

### Shihao Huang
I am a senior in both CS and Stat. Don't worry about prouncing my name wrong, I am really fine with that.
As a Chinese students, the reason why I am here is quite unexpected, when I was preparing my university entrance exam in high school, CSU and my high school they just formed a partnership program then I joined it and started my college career here.
I would say my English is good most of time but when it comes to some new concepts, local adage or sayings I don't konw, I still need to use my phone dictionary. If some day you find me suddenly being silent when communicating with you, I may just need to organize my language.
I consider myself an independent and self-displined person, I have procrastination but usually I will set myself a deadline before the true deadline. I have two siblings, they are the most invaluable gift that I received from my parents. Travelling and communicating with people from different background fasinate me. It is too young for me to write a bio(LOL), but as a materilist, I hope I can earn it every single day.

### Josh Keahey
I am currently a senior in CS, and I finished my math minor last semester. I have been going to school for a while now, as it took 
me a long time to figure out what I wanted to do with my life. After working some... not super exciting jobs for a while, I moved to 
China for 6 months in 2013. The trip changed my life, and helped me decide to come back and try to get a job in the gaming industry.
This major has not always been the easiest for me, but it has undoubtedly been rewarding and fun. In other walks of life, I love 
running, music, board games, making people laugh, and (it should go without saying) video games. Also, if there is some piece 
of random knowledge or pop culture reference, there is a high chance I will know it. I have so much utterly pointless 
information in my head.
