### Minjie Shen
Minjie is a senior Computer Science student, minoring in Math.
She is a transfer student, this is her third year in Colorado State University. 
She has studied in East China Normal University, China for two years and then transferred to CSU. 
She was an Electrical Engineering student and she has studied EE for 4 years. She tried to study both EE and CS at a time, but she just failed because it was so challenging to her. She realized that she preferred CS to EE, so she kept her CS major and got rid of the EE major.
She is so glad to work with all of the other WOPRers. She hopes WOPR could get everything done perfectly.

### Lacey Willmann
Lacey is a senior in the CS program. She decided to switch careers after retiring with a disability. Lacey had no programming experience before starting school at CSU. So far, she enjoys C and C ++, so she’s probably a little sadomasochistic? She is definitely diagnosable on some scale somewhere. Lacey has worked in team environments since she began working. That was probably before most of this class was born. I’m not even sure if electricity was around then. She has also worked in supervisory roles from 1999 until 2013. You could say she’s been around the block a few times!! She always asks for the more challenging assignments and works well under pressure. However, Lacey is old. We aren’t just saying that to be mean. We mean she is REALLY old. Due to her age, we prefer to not stress her. She is at the halfway mark for average life expectancy already and we can’t have her kicking the bucket at one of our team meetings. We have deadlines to  meet and we don’t want extra work!! When she gets too cantankerous, we put on a rerun of “The Golden Girls”. Calms her right down. Chocolate works, too. She forgets what she was upset about after a minute or two, so there are never any hard feelings. 

### Shihao Huang
I am a senior in both CS and Stat. Don't worry about prouncing my name wrong, I am really fine with that. As a Chinese students, the reason why I am here is quite unexpected, when I was preparing my university entrance exam in high school, CSU and my high school they just formed a partnership program then I joined it and started my college career here.
I would say my English is good most of time but when it comes to some new concepts, local adage or sayings I don't konw, I still need to use my phone dictionary. If some day you find me suddenly being silent when communicating with you, I may just need to organize my language.
I consider myself an independent and self-displined person, I have procrastination but usually I will set myself a deadline before the true deadline. I have two siblings, they are the most invaluable gift that I received from my parents. Travelling and communicating with people from different background fasinate me. It is too young for me to write a bio(LOL), but as a materilist, I hope I can earn it every single day.

### Josh Keahey
Josh is currently a senior in CS, and finished his math minor last semester. He has been going to school for a while now, as it took 
him a long time to figure out what he wanted to do with his life. After working some... not super exciting jobs for a while, he decided to moved to 
China for 6 months in 2013. The trip changed his life, and helped him decide to come back to the states and try to get a job in the gaming industry.
This major has not always been the easiest for Josh, but it has undoubtedly been a rewarding and fun experience for him. In other walks of life, he loves 
running, music, board games, making people laugh, and (it should go without saying) video games. Also, if there is some piece 
of random knowledge or pop culture reference, there is a high chance that he will know it. The amount of utterly pointless 
information in his head is impressive, if not a little sad.
    
# Manifesto

### Inclusion
Members of WOPR value cooperative, merit based decision making over hierarchical leadership. Every member will have input on the development process. Every member will be able to contribute to the project. WOPR embraces a true collaborative environment that respects open communication. Every idea or proposal brought to the table during a meeting will be considered. Team members will evaluate the idea. They will discuss what will work and things that may need to be addressed before the proposal can move forward. The team will make a decision based on the merit of every idea brought to the table. Every member of WOPR has the right to contribute. Every member of WOPR has the right to feel that their contributions are treated equally and with respect. WOPR is dedicated to fostering a respectful, open, and inclusive environment.

### Knowledge Sharing
In WOPR, no team member is better than the other, whether it's coding skills, Github knowledge, or any other trait. If some 
new piece of knowledge is acquired by a team member that would benefit the group, that knowledge will be shared. We value the 
fact that comprehension and understanding throughout the group will lead to working as a cohesive unit. With the sharing of 
knowledge, the team can help make each other better individuals, which in turn will make a better WOPR.

### Quality
Our team values quality over speed. We accomplish our tasks step by step, carefully. We won't blindly seek speed.
That also means we won't procrastinate and do everything before the deadlines. We know that if we move ahead quickly without deliberateness, we will end up with a mess. Every team member's work should be approved by the others and merged to the master by the others. 
We will try our best to achieve better quality.


### Responsibility
Members of WOPR will be responsible for their tasks. Assignees and reviewers will go over other people's work carefully. When members are in trouble, it is their responsibility to bring difficulties with their task to the table so other people can help with solving the problem. Every member will not only be responsible to the course-related assignment but also be responsible for the good values and orders we all recognized in Manifesto and Expectation.  

# Expectations

### GitHub Etiquette
Members are expected to check GitHub daily for active requests assigned to them. Members are expected to have notifications turned on for GitHub and Slack. WOPR has guidelines for acceptable response times for GitHub.

Acceptable Response Time | Urgency Rating 
-------------------------|----------------
Within 24 hours | 1 
Within 12 hours | 2 
Within 2-3 hours | 3 
Within an hour | 4 
Immediately | 5 

The acceptable response time will depend on the task and the request. It is up to the member requesting action from a teammate to rate their request using the appropriate label option. Team members will respond to all comments/requests that they are assigned to with, either a comment or an action (marking an item as reviewed, completing a merge, editing a file, etc.). Members are expected to comment on a GitHub request that is assigned to them if they will not be able to appropriately respond to the request within an acceptable time frame. In such cases, the initiator of the request will re-assign it to another teammate. If an action is assigned to more than one team member, all members who handle the request must comment on the issue/request with what actions they took.

### Punctuality
Members are expected to be punctual. First, all team members are expected to accomplish their tasks by the deadlines, which are decided by the team. Team deadlines maybe different from the deadlines required by Dave. If a team member has an emergency and cannot complete the tasks assigned to him/her, he/she must inform the other team members as soon as possible. That way the others can deal with that task and deadlines won't be missed. Second, all team members should attend the weekly team meetings on time. 
Though we value quality over speed, this does not mean we won't pay attention to the deadlines. We should follow the schedule  strictly and get all things done.

### Clarity
Clarity of goals and objectives is essential for success. It allows the team to focus on what's important, which increases their effectiveness and helps them make progress. Team members are expected to know their goals, destination of their jobs, how their jobs interacted with other people's work, how their work fits in the whole project. If not, team members are expected to question to clarify their job.  

### Communication
Associates of WOPR will hold each other accountable for great communication. This includes team meetings, in class 
discussions, and application based platforms such as slack, email, etc. Making sure everyone on the team is on the same page 
as often as possible will considerably cut down on time, increasing productivity. We expect members to ask questions if they 
are confused, and the rest of the team will try to help out. In special circumstances such as 'crunch' times near due
dates or Github emergencies, communicating with the team will be a high priority for each member so that the best possible 
product can be developed and finished on time.
