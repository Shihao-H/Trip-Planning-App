# Sprint 2 - *t03* - *WOPR*

## Goal

### A mobile, responsive map and itinerary!
### Sprint Leader: *Shihao Huang*

## Definition of Done

* Sprint Review and Restrospectives completed (sprint2.md).
* Version in pom.xml should be `<version>2.0.0</version>`.
* Increment deployed for demo and testing.
* Increment release `v2.0` created on GitHub with appropriate version number and name.


## Policies

#### Test Driven Development
* Write method headers, javadoc, unit tests, and code in that order.
* Unit tests are fully automated.
#### Configuration Management
* Code adheres to Google style guides for Java and JavaScript.
* Code Climate maintainability of A or B.
* Always check for new changes in master to resolve merge conflicts locally before committing them.
* All changes are built and tested before they are committed.
* All commits with more than 1 line of change include a task/issue number.
* All pull requests include tests for the added or modified code.
* Master is never broken.  If broken, it is fixed immediately.
#### Continuous Integration
* Continuous integration successfully builds and tests all pull requests for master branch.
* All Java dependencies in pom.xml.  Do not load external libraries in your repo. 


## Plan

*For Sprint2, team WOPR expects to build a TFFI that will handle a map and itenerary for a trip that the client requests. If
another unit is given that is different than the original three, we will be able to calculate it correctly as well. We
expect the site to work well on mobile devices, as well as computer monitors, with code that is clean and easily readable. 
When giving other teams our TFFI object, their server will respond correctly, and if we are given their TFFI object, ours 
will respond accordingly as well. We have 5 epics that we think will achieve this for us*
