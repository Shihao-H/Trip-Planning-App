*During the planning meeting we began by deciding on who would be the team leader for this sprint. Afterwards, we 
discussed the epics and looked at the new version of the TFFI document from the client. From those items, we decided on 
which new components would be a part of which epic and made tasks for creating them. We also discussed alterations that 
may have to be made to our existing application because of the additions and created tasks for those, as well. Once we 
had a basic plan together with the epics and tasks, we discussed how much work and time would be required for each task.
From this discussion, we decided to break up a few of the original tasks into smaller ones. We agreed on time estimates 
and assigned them to each task. We then discussed the priority of each task and all agreed on a final priority order. 
Finally, we set the ground rules on how the team was going to work together on this sprint to accomplish our goal. We 
agreed to treat the backlog as a priority que and pull the next available task when we finished one. We also agreed that 
each team member was going to contribute to the sprint2.md*
