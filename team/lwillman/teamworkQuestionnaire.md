# Teamwork Questionnaire for _Lacey_Willmann_

1. __Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail or something else?  What hours?__ 
   * Electronic mail or text is best. Any hours except MWF 10-10:50AM
1. __What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?__ 
   * My expectations are that we will complete the assignments ahead of or on time and that we will work together to accomplish this.
1. __What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?__ 
   * My goals are to practice my communication skills and to try to not be a leader on this project. I have worked in a supervisory role for 16 plus years. Going into a new field, I need to work on breaking the tendancy to lead.
1. __What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?__ 
   * Life, learning curve for new technology, my personal tendancy to be a supervisor, my tendancy to just get things done.
1. __What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?__ 
   * Then we discuss options for a solution to the problem. I have a lot of experience with conflict resolution, so I would use those skills to help facilitate an open discussion.
1. __Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?__ 
   * If it is agreed upon by all members of the team. 
1. __How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?__ 
   * I am unsure of the details of the assignment, but based on previous classes, I would say 6-8 hours a week for a program that works.
1. __How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?__ 
   * I would recommend a team meeting to discuss each members strengths and areas that they would like to improve skills on and decide together based on that.
1. __What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?__ 
   * The team should contact that person and find out why the commitment was missed. The action taken should depend on the reason and frequency of missed commitments. For a one time occurance due to circumstances outside of their control, such as a family emergency or illness/injury, I would ask that they try to communicate ahead of time going forward and then discuss options with the professor if a grade was impacted. If it is an ongoing issue, it should be brought to the professor's attention.  
1. __What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?__ 
   * It should be discussed in a group meeting to try and reach an agreement.
1. __How will you deal with different work habits of team members?__ 
   * I am extremely accepting of differing work habits, as long as the job is getting done and it is on par with the standards that have been set. If someone is struggling, I like to reach out and see if I can help in any way. 
1. __Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?__ 
   * I would prefer a set meeting schedule for team updates and discussing responsibilities, at the very least. I am open to discussion on how to handle other things.
1. __How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?__ 
   * I would say, at the very least, twice per sprint. Once to discuss responsibilities and once to check in on progress. My preference would be a routine meeting throughout the process. 
1. __Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?__ 
   * Not for every decision. I think it would be best for the entire team to agree on things that effect the entire team, however that is not always possible. Sometimes what is best for a team will conflict with personal preferences and interests.
1. __What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?__ 
   * If no compromise can be reached, then whatever the issue is should be resolved based on what is best for the team and what will be more likely to ensure success for the project.
1. __What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?__ 
   * That depends on the person and how the team is responding to it. The response could be a team meeting where it is openly and respectfully discussed; assigning a "team lead" role with some rules/guidelines for each sprint to avoid conflict, or something in between. 
1. __What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?__ 
   * Unless it became a full-time job, it would not bother me. As I stated previously, I have a lot of experience with conflict management and conflict resolution. I have also had ample training in that department.
