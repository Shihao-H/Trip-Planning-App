# Sprint 1 - *t03* - **WOPR**

## Goal

### Distance Calculator!
### Sprint Leader: *firstname lastname*

## Definition of Done

* Web application deployed on the production server (black-bottle.cs.colostate.edu).
* Version in server/pom.xml should be `<version>1.0</version>`.
* Sprint Review and Restrospectives completed (sprint#.md).
* Product Increment release `v1.0` created on GitHub.

## Policies

* All commits include a task/issue number.
* No commits to master

## Plan

Epics planned for this release.

* *61 RESTful Service for distance*
* *62 Responsive Client for distance calculator*

*During the planning meeting, each task was discussed. The requirements 
were explained and initial questions about the tasks were answered. GitHub 
was set up by creating the epics and issues for each task. Each member of the 
team was allowed to pick their own issue to work on. The team decided to allow 
the member with the lightest workload outside of this class to take on the fifth 
issue. This was an idea proposed by that member. A meeting schedule was set for 
the remainder of the sprint.*

## Review

#### Completed epics in Sprint Backlog 
* *61 RESTful Service for distance*:  *All issues were completed and merged*
* *62 Responsive Client for distance calculator* *All issues were completed and merged*

#### Incomplete epics in Sprint Backlog 
* *None*: *All were completed*
*

#### What went well
* *All team members adjusted quickly to the IntelliJ IDE*
* *Our code worked!!*
* *Our individual parts did not require a lot of debugging once they were merged together*

#### Problems encountered and resolutions
* *Initially, the team had trouble communicating with each other. Pull requests were waiting for 
days to be merged. Changes were being committed to the master on GitHub. For the first few days,
it seemed as though every member was doing their own thing. To address this, a team meeting was 
held where the members discussed the issues. During that discussion, it became clear that the 
issues were due to confusion about the specifications given by Dave or a lack of familiarity with
the technology being used. The team went over the specifications, sharing individual knowledge with 
each other, and worked together to become more apt with the programs and processes being used.
Since that meeting, things have been going much more smoothly.*

## Retrospective

#### What went well
* *First and foremost, the team completed the issues and the epics for sprint 1 ahead of time!*
* *All team members did a great job in remaining open to and respectful of others. Each member
played a part in keeping the initial issues from blowing up into something bigger by being willing
to talk through it and refraining from jumping to conclusions.*
* *The team valued meeting time and did not allow outside distractions to interfere*
* *Every member attended every meeting and actively participated*
* *Every member of the team contributed to the project in a meaningful and respectful way*

#### Potential improvements
* *The team made considerable improvements on the wait time from review request to merge. I would 
like to see the wait time improve more for the next sprint.*

#### What we will change next time
* *Each member will improve their response time to review/merge requests.*
